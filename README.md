# Using-IBM-PowerAI-Vision-to-count-cars-with-Object-Detection-feat.-Mark-Sturdevant
To count cars using IBM PowerAI Vision with Object Detection, you would typically follow these steps:

    Set up IBM PowerAI Vision: Ensure IBM PowerAI Vision is set up correctly on your machine. IBM PowerAI Vision is a comprehensive AI solution designed for visual recognition tasks like image classification, object detection, and more. The IBM PowerAI Vision platform provides an easy-to-use interface for model training and deployment.

    Train an Object Detection Model: The first step involves training a custom object detection model on labeled data (e.g., a dataset of images containing cars). You can upload images to IBM PowerAI Vision, annotate the cars, and train the model using the platform's graphical interface.

    Inference to Count Cars: Once the model is trained, you can perform inference (prediction) on new images to detect cars and count how many cars are in the image.

Here is a Python-based code snippet that shows how you can use a pre-trained object detection model (like the Faster R-CNN or YOLO) for car counting. This code assumes you're already familiar with how to upload data, train models, and use IBM PowerAI Vision for object detection.
Setup:

    IBM PowerAI Vision installed and configured properly.
    You have an object detection model trained to detect cars.

Python Code Example for Using Object Detection on Car Images:

# Import necessary libraries
import ibm_ai_v2
import cv2
import numpy as np

# IBM PowerAI Vision configuration
api_key = "your_ibm_powerai_vision_api_key"
project_id = "your_project_id"
model_id = "your_model_id"  # ID of the object detection model for car detection
url = "https://<your_instance_url>/v1.0"

# Initialize the IBM PowerAI Vision client
client = ibm_ai_v2.PowerAI(api_key=api_key, url=url)

# Load an image (replace this with your own image)
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"
image = cv2.imread(image_path)

# Pre-process the image (if needed)
image_resized = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))  # Resize to the model's input size if required

# Send the image to IBM PowerAI Vision for object detection
response = client.predict(
    model_id=model_id,
    images=image_resized
)

# Process the results from the response
# 'response' contains the detected objects with confidence scores and bounding boxes
detected_objects = response['predictions'][0]['objects']

# Loop through the detected objects to count cars
car_count = 0
for obj in detected_objects:
    if obj['class'] == 'car':  # Assuming 'car' is the class label in the trained model
        car_count += 1

# Display the image with bounding boxes and car count
for obj in detected_objects:
    if obj['class'] == 'car':
        # Get bounding box coordinates
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = obj['bounding_box']
        cv2.rectangle(image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Show the result with bounding boxes and the car count
cv2.putText(image, f"Car count: {car_count}", (10, 30), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
cv2.imshow('Detected Cars', image)

# Save the result
cv2.imwrite("car_count_result.jpg", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Explanation:

    IBM PowerAI Vision Setup:
        Replace "your_ibm_powerai_vision_api_key", "your_project_id", and "your_model_id" with the actual API key, project ID, and model ID that you have in your IBM PowerAI Vision setup.
        The url is the endpoint for the PowerAI Vision instance, which you can get from your IBM Cloud dashboard.

    Image Pre-processing:
        The image is loaded and resized to match the input size expected by the model.
        Depending on your model, you may need to change the image preprocessing (e.g., normalization, color format).

    Object Detection:
        The client.predict() method sends the image to the IBM PowerAI Vision server, which processes it using the trained object detection model.
        The model will detect various objects, including cars, and return bounding box coordinates and confidence scores for each detected object.

    Counting Cars:
        The code loops through the detected objects and counts how many of them are labeled as car (assuming the object detection model has been trained to detect cars with the label "car").

    Displaying Results:
        The bounding boxes around detected cars are drawn on the image using cv2.rectangle().
        The total car count is displayed on the image using cv2.putText().

    Result Output:
        The processed image is shown in a window with bounding boxes drawn around the detected cars and the car count displayed.
        The final image with detections and count is saved to disk as car_count_result.jpg.

Notes:

    Model Training: To make the code work, you would need a trained object detection model specifically for detecting cars. You can use IBM PowerAI Vision to train your model on labeled car images and export it.

    Pre-trained Models: If you're not training the model yourself, you can use pre-trained models like YOLO or Faster R-CNN, which are often used for object detection tasks.

    Accuracy: The accuracy of car detection depends on the quality of the model and the data used to train it. Ensure that your dataset is diverse enough to handle real-world variations in car appearance, lighting conditions, and angles.

    IBM PowerAI Vision offers an easy interface for training models, but you can also deploy models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other frameworks if needed.

This solution gives you a framework for detecting and counting cars in images using IBM PowerAI Vision. You can enhance and refine the model by adding more training data and fine-tuning it based on the specific use case and environment where the cars are captured (e.g., street scenes, parking lots, highways).
